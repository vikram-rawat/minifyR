# minifyR
 minify files and folders

This is a very very simple package. I am using **_GOLANG Minify Package_** Binary for windows for this package and thus No one needs to install anything for the package to work. If you want to read more about the **_MINIFY_** please visit at **https://github.com/tdewolff/minify/tree/master/cmd/minify**

This package has only 2 functions currently one for recursively minifying all the files inside a folder into another folder and secondly for minifying and bundling all the files into a single bundled file.

depending on the use case you can pick your poison.

package is totally experimental and only supports windows for now.

but it's easily extensible let me know if you need it for any other OS.
